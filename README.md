# Side-channel-powe-attack-on-AES
The AES implementation was targeted for Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA of SAKURA-x board.

Instructions for generating bitstream for AES:
  1. Use ISE or VIVADO (recommended) for bitstream generation
  2. Provide information for Kintex-7 fpga while creating the project
  3. For successful attack demonstration use the
